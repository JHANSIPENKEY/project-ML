Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

Steps to Build the Model:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Obtain a dataset where each movie has a plot summary and its associated genre labels. Clean and preprocess the text data (remove stopwords, punctuation, lowercase conversion, etc.). Convert text data into a format suitable for machine learning models (e.g., TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings).

Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

*Model Selection and Training: *

Choose a classifier such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the model on the training set.
